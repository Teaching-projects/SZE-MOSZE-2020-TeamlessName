## University Project, basic role-playing game

This little program simulates 2 characters fighting. The program runs until one of characters health points decrease 0 or below 0. These characters and their stats can be defined in command-line arguments.

To start program correctly, start with this format:

./a.out character1_name hp dmg character2_name hp dmg

For example.:

./a.out Rick 70 30 Morty 100 20

After starting program (with correct arguments) you can "move forward" the simulation by pressing ENTER.
