## University Project, basic role-playing game

This little program simulates 2 characters fighting. The program runs until one of characters health points decrease 0 or below 0. These characters and their stats can be defined in separate files, given in command line arguments.

To start program correctly, start with this format:

./a.out UNITFILE1 UNITFILE2

For example.:

./a.out unit1.json unit2.json

After starting program (with correct arguments) the program simulates the fight, then prints out the winners name and remaining hp.
